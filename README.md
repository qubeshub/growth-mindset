# Cultivating Your Growth Mindset

Created by Arietta Fleming-Davies and Jeremy Wojdak as part of BIOMAAP

BIOMAPP (Biology Students Math Attitudes and Anxiety Program) is an initiative supported with funding from the NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION. BIOMAAP aims to help undergraduate biology majors improve their attitudes and decrease their anxiety towards mathematics, and thus to help faculty teach quantitative topics in biology. BIOMAAP is a resource for educators who are looking to implement non-invasive techniques to change student attitudes and reduce anxiety towards math.
